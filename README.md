# Useful Arduino libraries

* [AstroTimes](/AstroTimes/README.md) - library providing stateless functions for calculating solar phenomena (sunrise, sunset, twilight) and moon phases
* [BooleanSolver](/BooleanSolver/README.md) - used to solve Boolean expressions in the form of strings
* [GD32 RTC Calibration](/GD32_RTC_Calibration/README.md) - library for calibrating the Real-Time Clock (RTC) on GD32 microcontrollers
* [I²C utility](/i2c_helper/README.md) - a set of functions to simplify communication with devices over the I²C bus
* [MAX7219](/max7219/README.md) - library to control MAX7219 chips (serially interfaced drivers for 8-digit 7-segment LED displays or LED matrices)
* [MCP402X](/mcp402x/README.md) - library to control MCP402X digital potentiometers
* [NTPClient](/NTPClient/README.md) - library provides a simple way to get the current Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) from a Network Time Protocol (NTP) server
* [TimeZone](/TimeZone/README.md) - library for managing time zone conversions between UTC and local time, with full support for daylight saving time (DST)
* [Wire](/wire_avr_one_buffer/) - modified ``Wire`` library for AVR architecture - uses only one buffer and has an increased transaction buffer to 160 bytes by default
